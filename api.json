      "summary": "Boston Township, Ohio (nicknamed 'Helltown'), a cluster of urban legends surrounding an abandoned town forcibly evacuated in 1974 for Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Legends are largely debunked.",
      "full": "Helltown refers to Boston Township in Summit County, Ohio, and the cluster of urban legends that grew around it. In 1974, the National Park Service forcibly bought out residents to expand the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area (now National Park), leaving numerous abandoned buildings. This abandonment spawned legends including a satanic church, chemical spill mutations, escaped mental patients, ghostly school bus, slaughterhouse horrors, and 'Python Patterson' (escaped giant snake). Reality: the area was simply abandoned for park expansion. No satanic activity, chemical spills, or supernatural events have been verified. The 'End of the Road' sign was merely a park boundary marker. Stanford House, a focal point of legends, was demolished in 2016. Stanford Haunted Trail, an actual Halloween attraction, may have fueled some legends. Multiple investigations found no evidence of paranormal activity. Status: Mostly debunked urban legends built on a foundation of actual abandonment."
